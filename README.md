ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eddie

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, most of which revolve around nature; specifically, waves and vibration. As a Signal Processing Engineer, I strive to employ principles of
waveforms, data and frequency domain analysis, in as many applications as I can.

ðŸŒ± Music is what drew me to electrical engineering, but being predisposed to music, I found it more interesting to learn about filters, amplifiers, data and AI in my formal
 education. These topics form the framework for my long-term vision of building an at-home audio lab: where music is not only recorded, mixed and mastered, but research and
 experimentation live through filtering effects, visualization and analysis software, and mechanical design.
 
There is a lot to look forward to, and much more for me to upload here. Stay curious, stay positive.
