ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Eddie

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in a lot of things, most of which revolve around nature; specifically, waves and vibration. As a Signal Processing Engineer, I strive to employ principles of
waveforms, data and frequency domain analysis, in as many applications as I can.

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning a few different things. I've been an avid guitarist for more than 14 years, and after playing right-handed for so long, I am beginning to learn how
 to play left-handed. Music is what hooked me into signal processing, but I always wanted to keep a broad scope of understanding; music is intuitive to me, so I found it more
 interesting to learn about filters, amplifiers, data and AI in my formal education. These topics form the framework for my long-term vision of building an at-home audio lab:
 where music is not only recorded, mixed and mastered, but research and experimentation live through filtering effects, visualization and analysis software, and mechanical design.
 
There is a lot to look forward to, and much more for me to upload here. Stay curious, stay positive.
